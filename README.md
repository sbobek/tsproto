# TSProto
Post-host prototype-based explanations with rules for time-series classifiers.

Key features:
  * Extracts interpretable prototype for any black-box model and creates a decision tree, where each note is constructed from the visual prototype
  * Integrated with SHAP explainer, as a backbone for extraction of interpretable components (However, SHAP can be replaces with any other feature-importance method)
